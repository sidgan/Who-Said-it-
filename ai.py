Project Idea: Find what proportion of males and females survived and make a predictive model based on this. 

Abstract: The sinking of the RMS Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history.  On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage,
 the Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg, killing 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew.
 This sensational tragedy shocked the international community and led to better safety regulations for ships.

One of the reasons that the shipwreck led to such loss of life was that there were not enough 
lifeboats for the passengers and crew. Although there was some element of luck involved in 
surviving the sinking, some groups of people were more likely to survive than others, such as women, children, and the upper-class.

Resources: For this question the data set is taken from Kaggle. The origin of the question is also from Kaggle. Analysis of what sorts of people were likely to
survive. In particular, application of the tools of machine learning to predict which passengers survived the tragedy.
